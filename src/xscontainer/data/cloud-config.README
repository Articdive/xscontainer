*** Please DO NOT override the template file in this directory ***

Overriding the default cloud-config template
============================================

It is possible to update the default template returned by xscontainer by
creating a file at this location:
    /opt/xensource/packages/files/xscontainer/cloud-config.template

Note:
* The same template must be replicated on every host in the pool.
* The directory 'xscontainer' may not already exist, and may need to be created.
